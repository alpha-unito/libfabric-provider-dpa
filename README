Introduction
============
This program is a libfabric provider for A3Cube's Ronniee Express 
(http://a3cube-inc.com/ronniee-express.html) fabric interface.


Libfabric is a communication library that exports interfaces for
fabric services to applications.  Libfabric is the core component
of the Open Fabrics Interfaces (OFI) framework.

The goal of OFI and libfabric is to define interfaces that enable
a tight semantic map between applications and underlying fabric
services.  Specifically, libfabric software interfaces have been
co-designed with fabric hardware providers and application developers,
with an initial focus on the needs of HPC users.  OFI supports multiple
interface semantics, is fabric and hardware implementation agnostic,
and leverages and expands the existing RDMA open source community.

This work is a part of Paolo Inaudi's MSc thesis at Computer Science
Department of University of Torino, under the supervision of Prof.
Marco Aldinucci. This is work has been made possible thanks to
the Memorandum of Understanding (2014) between University of Torino and 
A3CUBE Inc. that established a joint research lab at
Computer Science Department of University of Torino, Italy.
