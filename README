Introduction
============
This program is a libfabric provider for A3Cube's ronniee fabric interface.


Libfabric is a communication library that exports interfaces for
fabric services to applications.  Libfabric is the core component
of the Open Fabrics Interfaces (OFI) framework.

The goal of OFI and libfabric is to define interfaces that enable
a tight semantic map between applications and underlying fabric
services.  Specifically, libfabric software interfaces have been
co-designed with fabric hardware providers and application developers,
with an initial focus on the needs of HPC users.  OFI supports multiple
interface semantics, is fabric and hardware implementation agnostic,
and leverages and expands the existing RDMA open source community.
